It stood on a hill overlooking the village, some of its windows boarded, tiles missing from its roof, and ivy spreading unchecked over its face.  Once a fine-looking manor, and easily the largest and grandest building for miles around, the Riddle House was now damp, derelict, and unoccupied.\n",
            "\tThe Little Hagletons all agreed that the old house was \"creepy.\"  Half a century ago, something strange and horrible had happened there, something that the older inhabitants of the village still liked to discuss when topics for gossip were scarce.  The story had been picked over so many times, and had been embroidered in so many places, that nobody was quite sure what the truth was anymore.  Every version of the tale, however, started in the same place:  Fifty years before, at daybreak on a fine summer's morning when the Riddle House had still been well kept and impressive, a maid had entered the drawing room to find all three Riddles dead.  \n",
            "\tThe maid had run screaming down the hill into the village and roused as many people as she could.\n",

            "\tThe police were summoned, and the whole of Little Hangleton had seethed with shocked curiosity and ill-disguised excitement.  Nobody wasted their breath pretending to feel very sad about the Riddles, for they had been most unpopular.  Elderly Mr. and Mrs. Riddle had been rich, snobbish, and rude, and their grown-up son, Tom, had been, if anything, worse.  All the villagers cared about was the identity of their murderer -- for plainly, three apparently healthy people did not all drop dead of natural causes on the same night.\n",
            "\tThe Hanged Man, the village pub, did a roaring trade that night; the whole village seemed to have turned out to discuss the murders.  They were rewarded for leaving their firesides when the Riddles' cook arrived dramatically in their midst and announced to the suddenly silent pub that a man called Frank Bryce had just  been arrested.\n",
            "\t\"Frank!\" cried several people.  \"Never!\"\n",
            "\tFrank Bryce was the Riddles' gardener.  He lived alone in a run-down cottage on the grounds of the Riddle House.  Frank had come back from the war with a very stiff leg and a great dislike of crowds and loud noises, and had been working for the Riddles ever since.\n",
            "\tThere was a rush to buy the cook drinks and hear more details.\n",
            "\t\"Always thought he was odd,\" she told the eagerly listening villagers, after her fourth sherry.  \"Unfriendly, like.  I'm sure if I've offered him a cuppa once, I've offered it a hundred times.  Never wanted to mix, he didn't.\"\n",
            "\t\"Ah, now,\" said a woman at the bar, \"he had a hard war, Frank.  He likes the quiet life.  That's no reason to --\"\n",
            "\t\"Who else had a key to the back door, then?\" barked the cook.  \"There's been a spare key hanging in the gardener's cottage far back as I can remember!  Nobody forced the door last night!  No broken windows!  All Frank had to do was creep up to the big house while we was all sleeping...\"\n",
            "\tThe villagers exchanged dark looks.\n",
            "\t\"I always thought that he had a nasty look about him, right enough,\" grunted a man at the bar.\n",
            "\t\"War turned him funny, if you ask me,\" said the landlord.\n",
            "\t\"Told you I wouldn't like to get on the wrong side of Frank, didn't I, Dot?\" said an excited woman in the corner.\n",
            "\t\"Horrible temper,\" said Dot, nodding fervently.  \"I remember, when he was a kid...\"\n",
            "\tBy the following morning, hardly anyone in Little Hangleton doubted that Frank Bryce had killed the Riddles.\n",
            "\tBut over in the neighboring town of Great Hangleton, in the dark and dingy police station, Frank was stubbornly repeating, again and again, that he was innocent, and that the only person he had seen near the house on the day of the Riddles' deaths had been a teenage boy, a stranger, dark-haired and pale.  Nobody else in the village had seen any such boy, and the police were quite sure Frank had invented him.\n",
            "\tThen, just when things were looking very serious for Frank, the report on the Riddles' bodies came back and changed everything.\n",
            "\tThe police had never read an odder report.  A team of doctors had examined the bodies and had concluded that none of the Riddles had been poisoned, stabbed, shot, strangles, suffocated, or (as far as they could tell) harmed at all.  In fact (the report continued, in a tone of unmistakable bewilderment), the Riddles all appeared to be in perfet health -- apart from the fact that they were all dead.  The doctors did note (as though determined to find something wrong with the bodies) that each of the Riddles had a look of terror upon his or her face -- but as the frustrated police said, whoever heard of three people being frightened to death?\n",
            "\tAs there was no proof that the Riddles had been murdered at all, the police were forced to let Frank go.  The Riddles were buried in the Little Hangleton churchyard, and their graves remained objects of curiosity for a while.  To everyone's surprise, and amid a cloud of suspicion, Frank Bryce returned to his cottage on the grounds of the Riddle House.\n",
            "\t\"'S far as I'm concerned, he killed them, and I don't care what the police say,\" said Dot in the Hanged Man.  \"And if he had any decency, he'd leave here, knowing as how we knows he did it.\"\n",
            "\tBut Frank did not leave.  He stayed to tend the garden for the next family who lived in the Riddle House, and then the next -- for neither family stayed long.  Perhaps it was partly because of Frank that the new owners said there was a nasty feeling about the place, which, in the absence of inhabitants, started to fall into disrepair.\n",
            "\n",
            "\tThe wealthy man who owned the Riddle House these days neither lived there nor put it to any use; they said in the village that he kept it for \"tax reasons,\" though nobody was very clear what these might be.  The wealthy owner continued to pay Frank to do the gardening, however.  Frank was nearing his seventy-seventh birthday now, very deaf, his bad leg stiffer than ever, but could be seen pottering around the flower beds in fine weather, even though the weeds were starting to creep up on him, try as he might to suppress them.\n",
            "\tWeeds were not the only things Frank had to contend with either.  Boys from the village made a habit of throwing stones through the windows of the Riddle House.  They rode their bicycles over the lawns Frank worked so hard to keep smooth.  Once or twice, they broke into the old house for a dare.  They knew that old Frank's devotion to the house and the grounds amounted almost to an obsession, and it amused them to see him limping across the garden, brandishing his stick and yelling croakily at them.  Frank, for his part, believed the boys tormented him because they, like their parents and grandparents, though him a murderer.  So when Frank awoke one night in August and saw something very odd up at the old house, he merely assumed that the boys had gone one step further in their attempts to punish him.\n",
            "\tIt was Frank's bad leg that woke him; it was paining him worse than ever in his old age.  He got up and limped downstairs into the kitchen with the idea of refilling his hot-water bottle to ease the stiffness in his knee.  Standing at the sink, filling the kettle, he looked up at the Riddle House and saw lights glimmering in its upper windows.  Frank knew at once what was going on.  The boys had broken into the house again, and judging by the flickering quality of the light, they had started a fire.\n",
            "\tFrank had no telephone, in any case, he had deeply mistrusted the police ever since they had taken him in for questioning about the Riddles' deaths.  He put down the kettle at once, hurried back upstairs as fast as his bad leg would allow, and was soon back in his kitchen, fully dressed and removing a rusty old key from its hook by the door.  He picked up his walking stick, which was propped against the wall, and set off into the night.  \n",
            "\tThe front door of the Riddle House bore no sign of being forced, nor did any of the windows.  Frank limped around to the back of the house until he reached a door almost completely hidden by ivy, took out the old key, put it into the lock, and opened the door noisele\n"

            "\n",
            "\tThe villagers of Little Hangleron still called it \"the Riddle House,\" even though it had been many years since the Riddle family had lived there.  It stood on a hill overlooking the village, some of its windows boarded, tiles missing from its roof, and ivy spreading unchecked over its face.  Once a fine-looking manor, and easily the largest and grandest building for miles around, the Riddle House was now damp, derelict, and unoccupied.\n",
            "\tThe Little Hagletons all agreed that the old house was \"creepy.\"  Half a century ago, something strange and horrible had happened there, something that the older inhabitants of the village still liked to discuss when topics for gossip were scarce.  The story had been picked over so many times, and had been embroidered in so many places, that nobody was quite sure what the truth was anymore.  Every version of the tale, however, started in the same place:  Fifty years before, at daybreak on a fine summer's morning when the Riddle House had still been well kept and impressive, a maid had entered the drawing room to find all three Riddles dead.  \n",
            "\tThe maid had run screaming down the hill into the village and roused as many people as she could.\n",
            "\t\"Lying there with their eyes wide open!  Cold as ice!  Still in their dinner things!\"\n",
            "\tThe police were summoned, and the whole of Little Hangleton had seethed with shocked curiosity and ill-disguised excitement.  Nobody wasted their breath pretending to feel very sad about the Riddles, for they had been most unpopular.  Elderly Mr. and Mrs. Riddle had been rich, snobbish, and rude, and their grown-up son, Tom, had been, if anything, worse.  All the villagers cared about was the identity of their murderer -- for plainly, three apparently healthy people did not all drop dead of natural causes on the same night.\n",
            "\tThe Hanged Man, the village pub, did a roaring trade that night; the whole village seemed to have turned out to discuss the murders.  They were rewarded for leaving their firesides when the Riddles' cook arrived dramatically in their midst and announced to the suddenly silent pub that a man called Frank Bryce had just  been arrested.\n",
            "\t\"Frank!\" cried several people.  \"Never!\"\n",
            "\tFrank Bryce was the Riddles' gardener.  He lived alone in a run-down cottage on the grounds of the Riddle House.  Frank had come back from the war with a very stiff leg and a great dislike of crowds and loud noises, and had been working for the Riddles ever since.\n",
            "\tThere was a rush to buy the cook drinks and hear more details.\n",
            "\t\"Always thought he was odd,\" she told the eagerly listening villagers, after her fourth sherry.  \"Unfriendly, like.  I'm sure if I've offered him a cuppa once, I've offered it a hundred times.  Never wanted to mix, he didn't.\"\n",
            "\t\"Ah, now,\" said a woman at the bar, \"he had a hard war, Frank.  He likes the quiet life.  That's no reason to --\"\n",
            "\t\"Who else had a key to the back door, then?\" barked the cook.  \"There's been a spare key hanging in the gardener's cottage far back as I can remember!  Nobody forced the door last night!  No broken windows!  All Frank had to do was creep up to the big house while we was all sleeping...\"\n",
            "\tThe villagers exchanged dark looks.\n",
            "\t\"I always thought that he had a nasty look about him, right enough,\" grunted a man at the bar.\n",
            "\t\"War turned him funny, if you ask me,\" said the landlord.\n",
            "\t\"Told you I wouldn't like to get on the wrong side of Frank, didn't I, Dot?\" said an excited woman in the corner.\n",
            "\t\"Horrible temper,\" said Dot, nodding fervently.  \"I remember, when he was a kid...\"\n",
            "\tBy the following morning, hardly anyone in Little Hangleton doubted that Frank Bryce had killed the Riddles.\n",
            "\tBut over in the neighboring town of Great Hangleton, in the dark and dingy police station, Frank was stubbornly repeating, again and again, that he was innocent, and that the only person he had seen near the house on the day of the Riddles' deaths had been a teenage boy, a stranger, dark-haired and pale.  Nobody else in the village had seen any such boy, and the police were quite sure Frank had invented him.\n",
            "\tThen, just when things were looking very serious for Frank, the report on the Riddles' bodies came back and changed everything.\n",
            "\tThe police had never read an odder report.  A team of doctors had examined the bodies and had concluded that none of the Riddles had been poisoned, stabbed, shot, strangles, suffocated, or (as far as they could tell) harmed at all.  In fact (the report continued, in a tone of unmistakable bewilderment), the Riddles all appeared to be in perfet health -- apart from the fact that they were all dead.  The doctors did note (as though determined to find something wrong with the bodies) that each of the Riddles had a look of terror upon his or her face -- but as the frustrated police said, whoever heard of three people being frightened to death?\n",

            "\tbut frank did not leave  he stayed to tend the garden for the next family who lived in the riddle house and then the next  for neither family stayed long  perhaps it was partly because of frank that the new owners said there was a nasty feeling about the place which in the absence of inhabitants started to fall into disrepair\n",
            "\n",
            "\tthe wealthy man who owned the riddle house these days neither lived there nor put it to any use they said in the village that he kept it for tax reasons though nobody was very clear what these might be  the wealthy owner continued to pay frank to do the gardening however  frank was nearing his seventyseventh birthday now very deaf his bad leg stiffer than ever but could be seen pottering around the flower beds in fine weather even though the weeds were starting to creep up on him try as he might to suppress them\n",
            "\tweeds were not the only things frank had to contend with either  boys from the village made a habit of throwing stones through the windows of the riddle house  they rode their bicycles over the lawns frank worked so hard to keep smooth  once or twice they broke into the old house for a dare  they knew that old franks devotion to the house and the grounds amounted almost to an obsession and it amused them to see him limping across the garden brandishing his stick and yelling croakily at them  frank for his part believed the boys tormented him because they like their parents and grandparents though him a murderer  so when frank awoke one night in august and saw something very odd up at the old house he merely assumed that the boys had gone one step further in their attempts to punish him\n",
            "\tit was franks bad leg that woke him it was paining him worse than ever in his old age  he got up and limped downstairs into the kitchen with the idea of refilling his hotwater bottle to ease the stiffness in his knee  standing at the sink filling the kettle he looked up at the riddle house and saw lights glimmering in its upper windows  frank knew at once what was going on  the boys had broken into the house again and judging by the flickering quality of the light they had started a fire\n",
            "\tfrank had no telephone in any case he had deeply mistrusted the police ever since they had taken him in for questioning about the riddles deaths  he put down the kettle at once hurried back upstairs as fast as his bad leg would allow and was soon back in his kitchen fully dressed and removing a rusty old key from its hook by the door  he picked up his walking stick which was propped against the wall and set off into the night  \n",
            "\tthe front door of the riddle house bore no sign of being forced nor did any of the windows  frank limped around to the back of the house until he reached a door almost completely hidden by ivy took out the old key put it into the lock and opened the door noiselessly\n",
            "\the let himself into the cavernous kitchen  frank had not entered it for many years nevertheless although it was very dark he remembered where the door into the hall was and he groped his way towards it his nostrils full of the smell of decay ears pricked for any sound of footsteps or voices from overhead  he reached the hall which was a little lighter owing to the large mullioned windows on either side of the front door and started to climb the stairs bless\n"
